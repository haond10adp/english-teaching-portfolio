            <div>
                <p>For many years, I’ve been a solo developer, working tirelessly on a variety of projects. I poured my
                    heart and soul into creating something meaningful, but despite my efforts, none of my projects found
                    success or generated any income. The loneliness of working alone day after day began to take a
                    significant toll on my mental health. I found myself isolated in both a professional and personal
                    sense, and over time, that led to a diagnosis of depression. It was a challenging period, feeling
                    like I was stuck in a loop of effort without any payoff, both financially and emotionally.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Despite these struggles, life eventually took a turn. I found a job teaching English, which was a
                    huge blessing for me. It’s been over a year now, and I’m incredibly grateful for this opportunity.
                    While the job hasn’t pulled me out of the darkness, it has provided me with a stable income, a
                    routine, and a sense of purpose—things I desperately needed. It gave me a reason to keep going and
                    helped me regain some structure, even when everything else seemed uncertain.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Being an INTP, I’ve always gravitated toward solitary work, finding comfort and fulfillment in deep
                    thinking, complex problem-solving, and the independence that comes with working alone. I’ve often
                    preferred to dive into projects on my own, relying on my ability to think through challenges without
                    needing to consult others. This tendency toward isolation has been a core part of my identity, as it
                    allows me to immerse myself in the intricacies of ideas and concepts. However, as I’ve navigated
                    through the ups and downs of life—especially as a solo developer—I’ve come to realize that some of
                    the most valuable lessons have come from the very things I often resist. I’ve learned that while
                    independence is important, the ability to collaborate and work within a team can unlock creative
                    solutions and drive success in ways I couldn’t have achieved on my own. The value of teamwork became
                    evident when I saw how combining different perspectives and skills can create something far greater
                    than what any individual could accomplish alone. I’ve also come to understand the profound power in
                    vulnerability. Allowing myself to be open with others—whether it’s sharing struggles, asking for
                    help, or admitting my weaknesses—has brought unexpected strength and connection. It’s through these
                    moments of openness that I’ve learned the true power of resilience: it’s not just about bouncing
                    back from hardship, but also about growing and adapting from those experiences, with the support of
                    others.
                </p>
                <p>
                    While life has certainly not been easy, I’m learning to accept both the good and the bad. I’ve come
                    to embrace the journey, knowing that growth often comes from the most difficult moments. The path
                    hasn’t been linear, but I’m stronger for it, and now, more than ever, I believe in the power of
                    perseverance and the importance of surrounding myself with others who bring different strengths to
                    the table.
