            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <div>
                <p>My name is Hào. I'm 21 years old. </p>
                <p>I have been studying in the Information Technology field for three years through reading
                    documentation
                    and watching tutorial videos online, all in English. My career goal has always been to become a web
                    developer. After some fail interviews and unexpected internships, I realized that I'm unqualified
                    and
                    also unsuitable to become an employee in that field. I plan to continue studying it by myself so
                    that
                    one day I have enough knowledge to start my own business. </p>
                <p>In the meantime, I've got to get a job. I have never thought that I could be an English teacher
                    <strong>because teaching is just a hard job.</strong> </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Am I qualified enough to teach someone English?</li>
                    <li>What benefits will I bring to my students-to-be?</li>
                    <li>How can I build up their English knowledge? </li>
                    <li>I have been learning English for so long yet still consider myself a learner. </li>
                </ul>
                <p>I wish you (the recruiter) to answer some of the above questions and guide me on how
                    to be a good teacher
                    for the ultimate goal of education: <strong>help students discover knowledge within
                        themselves</strong>.</p>
